# Pomodoro-Timer

This project was to create a Pomodoro Timer utilizing React. The timer begins at the focus level and when the timer hits 0, a sound goes off. 
After that, the timer switches from focus to break. 

There are also buttons to adjust the timer as well. You can adjust the focus timer by increments of 5 minutes up to 60 minutes or as low as 5 minutes.
The break time timer can be adjusted by 1 minute up to 15 minutes and down to 1 minute to make sure you're still taking a break.

Lastly, there is a progress bar and a display of the remianing time. This helps the user understand how long they have been working and when the next break is or when their break is up.
